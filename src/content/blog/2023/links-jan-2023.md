- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) on [Examples of floating point problems](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/01/13/examples-of-floating-point-problems/) and [Examples of problems with integers](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/01/18/examples-of-problems-with-integers/)<br>
  It's good to get have some additional concrete examples of what often feel like abstract concerns.

- [Future of Memory Safety: Challenges and Recommendations](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Memory-Safety-Convening-Report-1-1.pdf)<br>
  Consumer Reports wades into the programming language safety debate? The source and timing are both mildly hilarious, but it's a good high level overview.
