Some interesting things I read this month:

- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) on [Examples of floating point problems](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/01/13/examples-of-floating-point-problems/) and [Examples of problems with integers](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/01/18/examples-of-problems-with-integers/)
  It's good to get have some additional concrete examples of what often feel like abstract concerns.

- [Future of Memory Safety: Challenges and Recommendations](https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Memory-Safety-Convening-Report-1-1.pdf)
  Consumer Reports wades into the programming language safety debate? The source and timing both mildly hilarious, but the content itself is good.

- [Geoff.Greer](https://geoff.greer.fm/) on [Software Rot](https://geoff.greer.fm/2017/02/28/software-rot/)
  A reminder that change is hard, and sometimes rewriting from scratch is not a bad option.
