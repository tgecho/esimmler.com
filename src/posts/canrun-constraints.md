_Be sure to have read [Building Canrun: A statically typed logic programming library for Rust (part 1)](@/2020-07-08-building-canrun-part-1.md)_ to put this article in context.

I had static types. I had a shiny new Rustified approach to managing `State`. Alongside this work[^timelines], I was plotting my next move: trying to bolt a [constraint system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_logic_programming) on top of my creation.

In basic [Î¼Kanren](http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf), any interactions must be modeled in a way that can be expressed through unification. While impressive results can be achieved with a bit of creativity (see: [math with Peano numbers](https://codon.com/hello-declarative-world#numbers)), I wanted something more direct, understandable and arbitrarily powerful.
